# Hengo Demo Projects

Each folder containing a `project.godot` file is a demo project meant to
be used with [Godot Engine](https://godotengine.org), the open source
2D and 3D game engine.

All projects are developed entirely in [Hengo, a Visual Script](https://github.com/Henrique-Henrique/Hengo) designed for the Godot Engine.

## Importing all demos

To import all demos at once in the project manager:

- Clone this repository or download a ZIP archive.
  - If you've downloaded a ZIP archive, extract it somewhere.
- Open the Godot project manager and click the **Scan** button on the right.
- Choose the path to the folder containing all demos.
- All demos should now appear in the project manager.
